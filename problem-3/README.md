# Problem 3

This problem consists of an AWS Batch job that is having problems. The /infrastructure folder contains a cloudformation template which creates the AWS Batch Job Definition.  The /code folder contains the python script which submits 3 Batch Jobs to the Job Definition created in /infrastructure.  The /log folder contains the resulting logs for each of the 3 jobs submitted.

Jobs 1 and 2 ran fine, but job 3 failed.

1) Why did job 3 fail?
1) What is a possible solution?
1) Are there any other possible solutions?
