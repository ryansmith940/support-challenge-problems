# Support Challenge Problems

This repository includes 3 challenge problems that would be typical for a Tier 2 support person to handle. The `README.md` file in each directory give instructions on what the problem is, and what questions are to be answered.

## Notes

* This assignment should be challenging, but not overly so. My target is that you can complete all three of these problems in an hour or less. If it is taking many hours, or you are stuck, I probably designed the problems poorly. Please contact me for help.
* We will talk about these problems in more depth at the interview. Some questions are open-ended and meant to spur discussion. Come prepared to talk about your answers, approach, and alternatives.
* Email your answers to ryand.smith@corteva.com before the interview.

Good luck!
